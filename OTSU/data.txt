How to apply hybrid spectral net algorithm on images, which has normal image and semantic segmentation of those images. give code in depth

My dataset is in the form of 
Main folder name semantic, it has 8 sub folders and 1 file
tile 1 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
tile 2 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
tile 3 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
tile 4 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
tile 5 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
tile 6 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
tile 7 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
tile 8 has 2 folders named images and masks folders
classes is a json file
classes contains this code {"classes": [{"title": "Water", "shape": "polygon", "color": "#50E3C2", "geometry_config": {}}, {"title": "Land (unpaved area)", "shape": "polygon", "color": "#F5A623", "geometry_config": {}}, {"title": "Road", "shape": "polygon", "color": "#DE597F", "geometry_config": {}}, {"title": "Building", "shape": "polygon", "color": "#D0021B", "geometry_config": {}}, {"title": "Vegetation", "shape": "polygon", "color": "#417505", "geometry_config": {}}, {"title": "Unlabeled", "shape": "polygon", "color": "#9B9B9B", "geometry_config": {}}], "tags": []}

masks folder contains semantic segmentation images of the the images in images folder
